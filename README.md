Students are often worried about their chances of admission in graduate school. The aim of this project is to help students in shortlisting universities with their profiles. The predicted output gives them a fair idea about their admission chances in a particular university. This analysis should also help students who are currently preparing or will be preparing to get a better idea.

This dataset was created for prediction of Graduate Admissions from an Indian perspective.
